# iplusd's SpidyVR fork

This fork adds a bunch of new features to [SpidyVR](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR), the Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered VR mod by Ilya Mezerowsky. 
I recommend following the mod’s original GitHub repository, but if you want to try out the features I’ve added before they’re officially released, 
it’s worth keeping an eye on this page.

## What's added

1. **Web Slingshot — new in 0.4.3**

   Enable **WEB SLINGSHOT**, stand still and attach a separate web from each hand to two solid surfaces. Pull both hands back and hold until the controllers vibrate, then release both web buttons together to launch toward the anchors. While enabled, firing a web on the ground no longer jumps automatically. Launch speed follows your swing speed limit.

2. **Better Climbing — new in 0.4.3**

   Enable **BETTER CLIMBING**, take one web in both hands and climb it hand over hand. Each pull takes in rope and keeps your progress while the other hand holds it. Reach up and regrip to keep moving toward the anchor. This improves web climbing, separately from wall climbing.

3. **FOV Slider**

   Turn **FOV SLIDER** on, then use **SPECTATOR FOV** directly below it to set the desktop and recording view between 40Â° and 150Â°. Turn it off to restore the standard recording view. Your chosen amount is saved, and the headset's view is unchanged.

   **FOV SMOOTHING** softens recording camera rotation without locking the horizon. Enable it and use **SMOOTHING AMOUNT** (25â€“500 ms) to adjust how much it smooths. Headset tracking stays immediate. Start with 150 ms; higher values add more smoothing and delay.

4. **Near Clip Fix**

   Sets the VR near clipping distance between 1 cm and 10 cm, preventing Spider-Man's chest and nearby parts of his arms from disappearing when they get close to the camera.

5. **Realistic Swinging**

   Adds momentum-based air rotation driven by web movement and physical arm gestures. It supports continuous rotations beyond 360Â°, left-stick steering, adjustable strength and drag, and an optional airborne A-button brake that smoothly returns you upright.

These controls appear in the game's **Settings â†’ SPIDY VR** menu.

Web Slingshot and Better Climbing are **OFF by default** and appear under **SWINGING**. Web bridges and enemy tethers are not included. The new features have passed automated tests; headset testing is still pending. See the [0.4.3 release notes](docs/releases/v0.4.3-iplusd.1.md).

Version 0.4.2 also fixes movement direction drifting after landing from momentum rotations. See the [release notes](docs/releases/v0.4.2-iplusd.1.md).

## HOW TO USE

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/iplusdvr/iplusds-SpidyVR/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder
3. Start **Spidy Launcher.exe**
4. Connect your headset, close the game if it is already running, and select **START VR**
5. In the game, open **Settings â†’ SPIDY VR** to adjust the new options
6. Realistic Swinging is disabled by default so make sure the **Realistic Flips: ON** to use the new swinging system

This is a complete fork, so a separate SpidyVR installation is not required. 
Installing an original SpidyVR package over the same folder will replace the fork's changes.

## Realistic Swinging controls

- **REALISTIC FLIPS** enables momentum-based air rotation.
- Arm movement and web-swing momentum determine the direction and speed of rotation; there is no fixed flip animation or preset turn count.
- The original **FLIPS** option keeps manual left-stick air rotation available alongside the momentum system.
- With **AIR BRAKE** enabled, pressing A in the air clears rotational momentum and smoothly restores the normal upright view without changing your heading.
- Strength, speed limit, response, hand influence, drag and activation thresholds can be adjusted in the same menu.

Realistic Swinging is disabled by default so existing controls continue to behave as expected until it is enabled.

## Building from source

The project requires Visual Studio 2022 C++ Build Tools and a Windows SDK.

```powershell
./tools/bootstrap.ps1 -Observer

./tools/package.ps1
```

The build keeps these additions together on this fork's `main` branch. Each feature also has its own clean branch and upstream pull request:

- [Web Slingshot pull request](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR/pull/28)
- [Better Climbing pull request](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR/pull/29)
- [FOV Slider pull request](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR/pull/21)
- [Near Clip Fix pull request](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR/pull/22)
- [Realistic Swinging pull request](https://github.com/IlyaMez/SpidyVR/pull/23)

More implementation details are available in [Custom changes](docs/CUSTOM_CHANGES.md). The [original SpidyVR README](docs/UPSTREAM_README.md) is preserved for the base mod's controls, requirements and troubleshooting.
